In this repository, we will do some data exploration on the Covid dataset obtained from: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.

I stumbled upon a youtube video title "Data Analyst Portfolio Project | SQL Data Exploration | Project 1/4" from Alex The Analyst, very cool stuff! So, I created this repository to practice my data exploration skills using PostgreSQL and also to have a way of keep track my progress in becoming a Data Analyst.
